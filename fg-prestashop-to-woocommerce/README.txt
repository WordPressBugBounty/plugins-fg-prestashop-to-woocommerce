== Installation ==

= Requirements =
WooCommerce must be installed and activated before running the migration.

= Installation =
1.  Install the plugin in the Admin => Plugins menu => Add New => Upload => Select the zip file => Install Now
2.  Activate the plugin in the Admin => Plugins menu
3.  Run the importer in Tools > Import > PrestaShop
4.  Configure the plugin settings. You can find the PrestaShop database parameters in the PrestaShop file settings.inc.php (PrestaShop 1.5+) or in the PrestaShop Preferences > Database tab (PrestaShop 1.4 and less)
5.  Test the database connection
6.  Click on the import button

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get the message: "[fgp2wc] Couldn't connect to the PrestaShop database. Please check your parameters. And be sure the WordPress server can access the PrestaShop database. SQLSTATE[28000] [1045] Access denied for user 'xxx'@'localhost' (using password: YES)" =

* First verify your login and password to your PrestaShop database.
* If PrestaShop and WordPress are not installed on the same host, you can do this:
- export the PrestaShop database to a SQL file (with phpMyAdmin for example)
- import this SQL file on the same database as WordPress
- run the migration by using WordPress database credentials (host, user, password, database) instead of the PrestaShop ones in the plugin settings.

= The import is not complete =

* You can run the migration again and it will continue where it left off.
* You can add: `define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '2G');` in your wp-config.php file to increase the memory allowed by WordPress
* You can also increase the memory limit in php.ini if you have write access to this file (ie: memory_limit = 2G).

= The images aren't being imported =

* Please check the URL field. It must contain the URL of the PrestaShop home page
* Check that the maintenance mode is disabled in PrestaShop

= Are the product combinations/attributes imported? =

* This is a Premium feature available on: https://www.fredericgilles.net/fg-prestashop-to-woocommerce/
